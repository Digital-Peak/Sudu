# Contribution

Want to contribute a bugfix or new feature to _Sudu_. No problem. Clone the repo, checkout a new branch and open a [new pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

## Code style
For every pr a code style check is performed. If there is a violation, then the pr is flagged with an error.

## Tests
Actually we have a PHP test suite which is executed on every pr or push. Make sure that every pr contains also a test case which covers the fix or new code.
